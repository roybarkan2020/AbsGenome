# Genome assembly workflow

This repository includes the primary steps that were used for the assembly of the topical abalone (*Haliotis asinina*). 
The sequencing data for this assembly included PacBio HiFi reads (Sequel II platform), Iso-Seq (full-length cDNA using PacBio SMRT sequencing) from 5 different tissues, and Dovetail's Omni-C (proximity ligation). Please refer to the GitHub link of each tool (provided) for more info and specifications. 

## Main steps:
1. Primary assembly
2. Scaffolding
3. Iso-Seq: genome annotation 
4. Mitochondrial genome assembly
5. CpG methylation - Measuring DNA methylation across the genome
